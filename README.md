# Overview
This is the accompanying research data for the paper de Guzman et al. (2023) - **Treated and highly diluted, but wastewater still impacts diversity and energy fluxes of freshwater food webs** accepted in Journal of Environmental Management.

An ecosystem-level manipulation experiment was conducted following a BACI (Before-After/Control-Impact) design, where part of the effluent of a large tertiary urban WWTP was diverted into a small nearly unpolluted stream to assess its effects on the structure of the biological community and on the energy fluxes along the food web. 

Five datasets are provided together with the code.
